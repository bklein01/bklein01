- 👋 Hi, I’m @bklein01
- 👀 I develop applications using PHP using the Symfony framework.
- 👀 I’m also interested in developing applications with Oracle Apex and PL/SQL. I love all things databases, especially Oracle, MongoDB, and MySQL. I will dabble with PostgreSQL and SQL Server too, but not as much. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Oracle Apex and Oracle Cloud administration.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different and interesting projects with business focus.
- 📫 How to reach me is through my website at https://kleinis.me or via email at bklein73@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been developing since I was 13 years old and remember a little known database called Access 1.0 where I created a CRM before it was a thing.
